# LLMancer.nvim üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A Neovim plugin for chatting with LLMs.

## ‚ú® Features

- Everything is just a normal buffer as much as possible
- Chat all in one buffer, instead of multiple windows
- LLM doesn't need to provide line numbers in it's responses, it's a two step process to apply changes

## üì¶ Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
    'srcrip/llmancer',
    dependencies = {
        "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
        -- required for listing past chats (telescope coming soon)
        "ibhagwan/fzf-lua"
    },
    config = function()
        require('llmancer').setup({
            anthropic_api_key = 'your-api-key-here', -- Required
            -- Optional configuration...
            model = 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
            max_tokens = 4096,
            temperature = 0.7,
            close_chat_buffer_on_win_closed = true, -- Whether to close the chat buffer when its window is closed
            add_files_to_new_chat = "all", -- Which files to add to context when creating a new chat ("all", "current", or "none")
        })
    end,
    keys = {
        { "<leader>ll", "<cmd>lua require('llmancer').open_chat()<cr>",  desc = "Open LLMancer Chat" },
        { "<leader>lc", "<cmd>lua require('llmancer').list_chats()<cr>", desc = "List LLMancer Chats" },
