## Installation

Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):


todo:
- add some context on which files the user has open

You can expand this further by:
1. Adding better error handling
2. Implementing a proper chat history system
3. Adding syntax highlighting for the chat buffer
4. Adding more LLM providers
5. Adding commands instead of just Lua functions
6. Adding status indicators while waiting for responses
