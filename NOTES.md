These are just some working ideas I have:

- add command interface
- add commands to edit files list
- you can hit enter multiple times while its thinking
- numbers in prompt still dont always increment right. they failed to increment right during an error
- maybe add a fill in this line helper?
- what if there was some new popup that showed you all the files you have open and let you toggle them on off for the current chat, plus you could just add new lines to add a new file?
